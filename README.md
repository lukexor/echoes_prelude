# Echoes: Prelude in Shadow

It's a dark, rainy night with a crescent moon rising high, barely visible
through gaps in the clouds. In the silence of a graveyard, something stirs. A
slow grinding of stone against stone rings out from a crumbling crypt atop a
hill.

Venture into the dark and listen closely to the echoes of the past, obscured in
shadow and mystery.
