# Echoes: Prelude in the Abyss

In the far-distant future, humanity will have thrown off the shackles of
their physical existence, preferring to dedicate their consciousness to
the limitless possibilities of cyberspace. Their bodies float idly in
deprivation tanks filled with viscous fluid monitored and kept healthy by
automated systems.

It's a utopia for those in the simulation, everything existing in harmony, but
something stirs within. Echoes of human consciousness that do not belong.
